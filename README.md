# Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System using Machine Learning

**Green Skilly** is a Machine Learning-based system designed to assist farmers in making smart agricultural decisions. It predicts the most suitable crop to cultivate and recommends the ideal fertilizer based on soil and environmental conditions.

## 🌾 Project Overview

Farmers often struggle to determine which crop to grow and which fertilizer to use due to lack of soil knowledge and expert advice. This project solves that problem by using historical data and machine learning models to generate accurate, data-driven recommendations.

### Key Features:

- **Crop Recommendation System**
  - Predicts the best crop to grow based on:
    - Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium (NPK)
    - pH level
    - Moisture
    - Temperature
    - Humidity
    - Rainfall

- **Fertilizer Recommendation System**
  - Suggests the most suitable fertilizer based on nutrient deficiencies in the soil (N, P, K).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python  
- **Platforms**: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries**:
  - `Pandas` – Data preprocessing
  - `Scikit-learn` – Machine learning (Decision Tree Classifier)
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` – Visualization

## 📊 Performance

- Crop prediction accuracy: **98.48%**
- Fertilizer recommendation accuracy: **100%** (based on rule-based nutrient evaluation)

## 📌 Methodology

1. **Data Collection** – Collected datasets related to soil and crop yield.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handled missing values and normalized data.
3. **Model Training** – Used Decision Tree Classifier for both crop and fertilizer prediction.
4. **Evaluation** – Tested on real-world-like data with high performance.
5. **User Interface (Notebook)** – Simple inputs and clear outputs for ease of use.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Integrate **Random Forest Classifier** for better generalization.
- Introduce **Deep Learning** models for more complex data.
- Use **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for voice/text input from users.
- Build a web or mobile application for easier access.
